This is an app where a company can create its sales target for the next year. In the main page, you'll see some filters, then a dataframe with products information and the amount of sales. The last columns are filled according to the percentage you indicate in the sidebar form 'Inserir Metas'.

Once sales target (%) has been created, a second dataframe is shown right below, with sales target divided by month, according to monthly sales average for each product.

The last dataframe shows a summary of sales, for this year, and targets, for the following year, according to each business area.

In case of doubt, when you hover the mouse over the header of any column, there will be explanations about what it represents.
